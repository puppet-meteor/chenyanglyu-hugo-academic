Hi there. I am a third-year Ph.D. student working with Prof. [Raheem Beyah](http://rbeyah.ece.gatech.edu/) and Prof. [Shouling Ji](http://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html) in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Prior to joining GaTech, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2018.
